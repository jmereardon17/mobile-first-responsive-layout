# Mobile-first Responsive Layout

A responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. A treehouse FEWD techdegree project in which I was given three image mockups for a mobile, tablet, and desktop layout. I had to match the designs perfectly, where I had to write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I had to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.

Extra development for achieving the highest grade:
- Further enhance the project by adding an additional Google font.
- Add an additional skills section to the page.
- Add additional styling to links.

Browsers tested for compatibility:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
